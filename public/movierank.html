    <h3> The Banshees of Inisherin(2022)</h3>
    <p> I loved this movie particulary because of its excellent performace and story that commits fully to the premise. The
        premise of the movie involves a loss of friendship and throughout the movie we see the whys and hows and whens too.
        The character motivation is one of the most human element in the story, the pettiness. Our two main character,
        Pádraic Súilleabháin(played by Colin Farrell)
        and Colm Doherty(played by Brendan Gleeson) are at odds at each other over what seems to he small stuff, but over
        the course of the story it becomes something
        even bigger. The other main characters, who have equally important part in this story, Siobhán Súilleabháin(played
        by Kerry Condon) and Dominic Kearney(played by Barry Keoghan)
        add much to the story of what it is to be human and remembered. We see the character go through changes through the
        story that resontes with many, but even to those who it does not
        it is still bloody good story. </p>
        
        <h3>
            Kaathal - The Core(2023)
        </h3>
        <p>
            The second movie on our list is the malayalam movie Kaathal - The Core. This movie stars Mammooty and Jyothika as husband and wife, Mathew and Omana Devassy
            as they go through a huge change in their married life; a divorce. The diorce is filled by the wife Omana, and although it seems out of nowhere, we learn of why Omana has done so soon enough.
            Although the first half of the movie is slow in pacing, it sets up pretty well for the next half of the movie and we find the importantance every scene. The story itself is beatifully told, with both the soundtrack, and cinematography being nothing but excellent.
            Now more on the story, we learn soon enough that the divorce was filed due to Mathew neglecting the physical needs of the wife, and on the basis of cruelty. But this does not come at
            all negative asepct either. In this same scene we learn of what we suspected earlier, that Mathew is gay and this is the reason that their marraige was mostly sexless.
            Mathew is closeted, even he himself is not fully aware of his sexuality. We learn of how Omana dealt with this, and how thier daughter also dealt with it. 
            The story also touches on the other party, Mathew's close friend, Thankan, who were intimate before Mathew's marraige to Omana, but also not as intimate as we think. 
            The moive deals with the issues surrounding around such marriage where one or both parties are homosexual, and how women are trapped in such marraiges as they have less power and fincaial dependecny problems.
            After one of the courtroom scene where Mathew's sexuality was questioned, he meets with an advocate from local LGBTQ+ group where he offers support for Mathew in this case. 
            Mathew is seen questioing and a chang in him is seen in this scene where I think Mathew fully accepted his homosexuality. 
            The next scene in the movie, which involved Mathew and his father, is the most impactful scene I have seen in a malayalam movie.
